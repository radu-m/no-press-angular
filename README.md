# no-press-angular

AngularJS client with hello-world application.

## Getting Started

`cd` into this repo dir and do

```
npm install
```

Assuming all went well (rearely does, but wish you best of luck), now you can start the dev server by doing

```
npm run dev
```

..that's it! Webpack should have opened a new tab and should be watching over your files.

## Happy dev!
